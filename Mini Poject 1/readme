Mini Project 1:
Design a website for a college. There should be at least 15 web-pages present 
in the web-site. There should be:
One Home page that leads to other pages. The Home page should 
contain the name of the college as heading along with the college logo. There 
should be a tab with the following links:
Home;
Academics;
Admission;
Gallery.
There should be an appropriate description of the college on the home 
page.
One Academics page which contains a list of all the departments 
present in the college â€œArts, Science and Commerce. The list should be a nested 
list, with available courses mentioned under each department. There should be 
a minimum of two courses under each department, (for e.g. Computer Science 
and Mathematics under Science, English and Sociology under Arts and so on). 
Each Course entry in the list should be a HTML link that leads to a web-page 
totally dedicated to the course itself.
Each Course should have its own dedicated web-page. This page 
should contain a description about the course, a list of all the teachers taking the 
course and the timetable for that particular subject.
The admission page basically contains a form that a student needs to 
fill up in order to take admission in the college. The form should ask all the 
necessary questions using appropriate form elements.
One gallery page that contains set of photos taken of the college and 
its students.
Please note that each web-page in this website should have the same background 
Image/color. The looks of each page should be similar.
